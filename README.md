# DirectoryFlattenerRS

This project was created in order to copy the contents of multiple directories that are present in the input directory to their respective counterparts in the output directory.

The main functionality of this code is that it detects a file extension that was passed and copies only the files that match the file extension to the output directory.

Subdirectories of the directories that are used as an input are not preserved. Files are copied onto a flat structure. The mapping of the old directory structure is saved into a .json file.
